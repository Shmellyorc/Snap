/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The pool maintains separate instance limits for both global usage (<see cref="MaxGlobalInstances"/>)
/// and per-sound usage (<see cref="MaxInstancePerSound"/>). When these limits are approached,
/// the pool employs a least-recently-used strategy to determine which instances to recycle.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Use this class through the <see cref="Sound"/> playback methods rather than directly creating
