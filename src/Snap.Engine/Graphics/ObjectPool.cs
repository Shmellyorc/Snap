/// <para>
/// This pool maintains a collection of available objects that can be rented and returned.
/// When an object is requested and the pool is empty, new instances are created using
/// a factory function. Returned objects are reset to a clean state for future use.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This implementation is suitable for objects that are expensive to create or destroy,
/// such as audio instances, particle systems, or network connections. The pool helps
